### Wiring info and PCB for easy upgrade of older AMC1280USB controller for use with AASD-15A servos

You can wire directly the DB25 connectors using the capacitors and resistors alike in the diagram:

But you can always order easy PCB's for the DB25 connectors that already have pads to solder 0805 resistors and capacitors. You can order the PCBs on https://www.elecrow.com/ for example.
